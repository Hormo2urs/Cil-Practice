DAY 1
Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI model
Making diagnosis in a hospital: History taking, examination, investigation, management. These are some of the layers involved and it's kind of similar to the OSI model, albeit not tech inclined.
 
Garri processing. This is also oddly similar to the OSI model. It involves the passage of the cassava through several layers before it ends up as the garri.
 
Then, there is the TCP/IP model This model doesn't conform to the OSI model since the TCP/IP model is a standard based on the OSI model whilst the OSI model is a functional guideline .
 
Cisco 3 layered structure: the core, the distribution and the access point perfectly fits into the OSI model idea  since both are based on functions 
Access layer: comprises the end users devices like PCs, phones,printers. Web browsers which use the application layer protocol of the OSI model are found as an app in PCs.
Wired and wireless access points and hubs which are devices found in the physical layer of the OSI model are also found at the access layer of the Cisco layer
Inside the web browsers you will get the presentation layers which convert human language to machine language and compresses data and encryption of data is ensured when a ssl is used.
Session layers are the app APIs which manage the sessions and do authentication and authorization.
Distribution layer: ensures routing of boundaries, filtering of traffic and Qos(quality of service), segmentation.
Segmentation, flow control are the functions of the transport layer of the OSI and the routers which are also found at this layer are also found at the transport layer of the OSI. LAN addressing are done here which is the network layer of the OSI
Core layer: ensures connectivity to the internet which falls under the network layer of the OSI
SS7-Signaling system 7: Explains what happens in telecommunication, i.e how voice signal is transmitted from one end to another, it explains this process in layers similar to the OSI model;
Physical layer: defines the physical and electrical characteristics of the link
Message transfer layer part 2: it provides link layer functionality to ensure messages are reliably exchanged, it functions includes, error checking, flow control, and sequence checking.
Mmessageposs5. Mmessage transfer layer part 3: this layer provides addressing, routing,and congestion control Signaling connection control part: provides capability to address application within a signaling point.point.
Transaction capabilities application part: defines messages and protocols used to communicate between applications such as services, calling card services in the nodes and switches,,meassagesn
Operation, maintenance, and administration part: this layer functions includes, validation of route table and diagnosis of links.

DAY 6

Scrum is a software product development framework that helps an organization (mostly software company) address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value to their customers. Scrum is a subset of Agile methodology.

Some of the benefit of Scrum in software development are;
Clear Team Roles
In a Scrum Team, everyone understands their role and what responsibilities this entails. This is an excellent safeguard – nothing gets missed.
It also creates a tightly-knit, high-performing team. Each member trusts that the others will carry out their roles and communicate if any assistance is required.
Lower Risk
The combined elements that make Scrum more communicative, flexible, and productive make it a lower risk project. Risk can be easily avoided and mistakes can easily be corrected with scrum.
Flexibility
Scrum is a project management methodology designed to respond easily and positively to change. With conventional project management methods and management courses, changing requirements can be a nightmare to handle. Is the opposite with approaches like Scrum and its parent methodology, Agile. They are designed to be responsive at all stages in a project’s life cycle.
Fast & Frequent Value
In a Scrum project, value is delivered to the stakeholders (often customers) early on and throughout the project’s lifecycle. Unlike other methods, customers can be enjoying the product while the scrum team is improving the product, debugging and finishing the product to be launched in full.

Transparency
Transparency is one of the 3 Pillars of Scrum, the foundational principles upon which the rest of Scrum is built. Different elements within a Scrum Sprint (project cycle) help to uphold this pillar. The Scrum Board displays ongoing tasks and their progress, the Daily Standup Meeting provides an opportunity to flag any obstacles, and the Sprint Planning and Review clearly outline the priorities and achievements of the Sprint respectively.


From the Agile Manifesto, complete the following: 
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

I work as Industry Analyst and Wordpress developer at Bridgia, a platform for Higher Education(Students and Educators). And majorly what I do is User research work i.e Research and curate technology companies that provide free access to their software for universities. And other companies that provide or support academic programmes such as innovation challenges, research opportunities, and graduate recruitment by these companies.

And also analyze the data gathered through different platforms.

UX Design is a term used to describe the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context.

What a UX designer does is to make sure every user’s interaction or experience with a product or service goes smoothly. And they perform their duties through user research, user research analysis, preparing a user persona & user flows, wireframes & prototype, and user testing.

UX is different from other design fields  because other design fields focus on visual elements and visual design. While UX designers take a broader perspective by focusing on the entire interaction between a user and a product.
Gloria Lo Portfolio
Gloria has nailed her designer introduction with a three-tiered approach. First, she treats us to a bold, eye-catching headline that describes her in terms of her favorite activities.
Gloria was able to convey the most important information while managing the delicate art of brevity. That is very brave of her and very professional.

Gloria's portfolio also features a comprehensive “About” page, complete with a video, a section detailing her values (with the help of emojis), a very thorough testimonial from a former employer, and links to her music and artwork.

Gloria can still work more on her  portfolio homepage since it will be the first place the users will visit. She can move content to make it more and more explanatory.

Olivia Truong Portfolio
Olivia’s portfolio demonstrated how she identifies and tackles a variety of user problems. Olivia’s portfolio does a great job of this.

Gloria’s portfolio took the problem personal and empathy-driven, which is a critical part of being an UX Designer.

UX designers are problem-solvers, so Olivia’s portfolio did a good job reflecting that.

Olivia can talk more about herself and put some projects she previously worked on, the problems she faced and how she tackled them.

 Article on UI/UX Fundamentals

UI/UX are professional roles in the Tech industry and sometimes used interchangeably but these are different roles that play different importance in a company.

In the following paragraph we are going to look at what each role is, the part they play in the organization and different roles that can be found under them, and possibly skills that are needed for these roles.

UX design refers to the term “user experience design”, while UI stands for “user interface design”

What is UX Design
User experience (UX) design is the process of designing effective, efficient, highly usable, inclusive, and even delightful experiences for human beings. In the context of the field of UX design, this typically relates to digital product experiences—meaning mobile apps and websites.
To put it even more simply, UX design is the process of designing great digital product experiences that work well for the people who use those products.

Part UX Designer plays in an organization i.e what do UX designers actually do
Take the time to understand what people actually need in a digital product experience
Identify problems and pain points in the user experience
Design to meet users’ needs and solve problems and pain points
Design in ways that also meet business needs and constraints
Test and iterate on their designs to ensure that the experience continuously evolves to meet users’ needs (even as those needs change!)

Different roles that can be found are;
UX/UI Designer
UX Researcher
UX Strategy 
UX Writing

Skills needed to be successful as a UX Designer are;
Critical thinking
Creative thinking
Empathy
Problem Solving and many more.

There are stages in which a UX Designer follows to produce a good and quality design and they are;
Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test.

What is UI Design
User interface (UI) design refers to the visual design of a product’s digital interface, such as an app screen or website. It’s the process of designing the visual and interactive properties of a visual experience, ensuring the interface is both clear for the user to navigate and overall aesthetically pleasing. 

Part UI Designer plays in an organization i.e what do UX designers actually do?
UI designers are responsible for ensuring the product’s interface is visually stimulating, easy to navigate, and in line with business goals. 
They’re also responsible for establishing visual consistency across a digital product through creating style guides and UI pattern libraries. 
UI designers have the complex task of considering all the visual aspects of the user’s journey

Different roles that can be found are;
UI/UX Designer
Visual Designer
Motion Designer

Skills needed to be successful as a UX Designer are;
Collaboration and communication
An interest in people and human behavior
A keen eye for aesthetics and sharp attention to detail
